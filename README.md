## **üéØ Project Summary & My Role**

This project involved designing a comprehensive **5+ year career path framework** for **AWS Data Engineers** at AllCloud, created as part of a job application screening activity. My role was to develop a clear, actionable roadmap for employee professional development, integrating technical, interpersonal, and intrapersonal skills with measurable success metrics.

## **üìà Objective**

To provide AllCloud employees (especially those new to career pathing) with a transparent understanding of growth opportunities, fostering their professional development and aligning individual growth with organizational success.

## **üí° Key Deliverables & Approach**

I developed a multi-stage career progression model, detailing:

* **Progression Stages:** Junior, Mid-Level, Senior, and Beyond Senior (Principal/Architect/Management).
* **Required Skills:** Specific AWS technologies (S3, Glue, Redshift), technical knowledge, intrapersonal skills (e.g., Time Management, Problem-Solving), and interpersonal skills (e.g., Customer Communication, Presenting).
* **Certifications:** Relevant AWS certifications (e.g., Cloud Practitioner, Data Analytics - Specialty).
* **Success Metrics:** Defined measurable indicators for each skill and stage (e.g., manager feedback, code review, certification completion, stakeholder feedback).

The framework was designed for clarity and ease of understanding for a non-technical employee audience.

## **üåü Impact**

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* **Design & Structure HR/Talent Programs:** Create clear, measurable frameworks for employee development.
* **Bridge Technical & People Domains:** Translate complex technical roles into understandable career progression.
* **Communicate Strategically:** Present complex information effectively to diverse audiences (as required for the employee audience).
* **Utilize People Analytics Principles:** Integrate skill assessment and success measurement into talent development.
