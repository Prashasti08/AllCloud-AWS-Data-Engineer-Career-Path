## Project Prompt

"We are developing career paths for employees in technical roles. Use an AWS Data Engineer role as an example and create a suggested career path for employees in this role. The career path should show progression over 5+ years and include relevant AWS and related technologies certifications, required technical knowledge and skills, intrapersonal skills such as time management and accountability, and interpersonal skills such as customer communication and presenting/public speaking. Include as many components as you like in the suggested career path, and identify how you will measure success of each one (self-ratings, manager feedback, course completions, etc.). Create a brief mock PPT/Google Slides/any presentation software slide deck and feel free to make use of generative AI tools for content and design. Assume that your audience is employees who will likely be encountering a career path for the first time and want to understand how it will aid their professional development at AllCloud - what questions might they have that we should answer proactively? Make as many assumptions and take as much creative liberty as you like!"
